Compleated lesson 18 task from SkillBox (nothing new here)
(My teacher is still winning in our code review competition, 
he probably doesn't suspect about it, but who cares? Our score is about 4 : 2. 
But my 2 points much more important, probably their team have to fix their autotests a bit)
Get some practice with python re library.
